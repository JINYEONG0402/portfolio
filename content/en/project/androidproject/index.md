This project aims to emphasize its differentiation from existing restaurant applications and provide user-friendly functions. The main function of the app is the random recommendation function. Through this, it expands the user's choice by randomly recommending restaurants affiliated with Chonbuk National University. In addition, it provides a personalized experience by introducing a wish list function so that users can store and manage their preferred restaurants. The friend add function builds a system where users can add friends and share information on each other's restaurants.

A notification system is also designed to instantly deliver news through real-time announcements. The technology stack uses the MySQL database and PHP API to store and manage information about famous restaurants. It also includes the ability to search for information about famous restaurants using the Kakao API and to display locations on maps. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making the login and membership registration process simple.

The list of famous restaurants makes it easy for users to find the restaurants they want through the filter function, and the detailed page provides detailed information on the restaurants they click on. The review creation function induces interaction between users and implements a system that can store and display review contents. Through these functions, the Jeonbuk National University restaurant recommendation app aimed to provide a platform for users to conveniently search and share information on famous restaurants.
