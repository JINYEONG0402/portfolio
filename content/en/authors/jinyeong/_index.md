Hello! I’m Jin-Young Ko, a developer who learns new technologies quickly and connects them to real projects. 
I’ve worked across a wide range of areas—from front-end development to AI-powered automation—always 
enjoying the process of experimenting with new tech and turning ideas into actual services. I’m continuously 
growing as a developer who sees problems through to the very end. On my journey to becoming an AI engineer, 
I’ll keep pushing forward with determination!
